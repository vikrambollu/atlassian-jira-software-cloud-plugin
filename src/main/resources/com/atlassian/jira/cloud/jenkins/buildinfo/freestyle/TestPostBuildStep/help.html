    Once you install the Jenkins plugin and set up the configuration page, you need to add a ‘build step’ in your pipeline. This is what tells the Jenkins pipeline, when running, to send data to Jira or not.
    You can use the optional 'branch' parameter to override the branch name we use to determine the issue keys associated with the current build.

    <br />

    You generate a Pipeline script, then use this in your Jenkinsfile.

    <br />
    Please select the Jira Software Cloud site name you would like to create the pipeline script for. You can only select 1 site at this time. If you want to send information to multiple sites, please create multiple Pipeline Scripts.
